# Full-Stack_Web_Development
This repository is a full-stack web development project built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It covers key techniques such as API integration, database management, and authentication. Ideal for learning modern web development practices and building scalable, responsive applications.<br><br>
🚀 ## __Phase 1: JavaScript Fundamentals & Modern Web Dev__
<br>🔧 Tasks:<br>
• Learn variables, data types, operators<br>
• Control structures (if, switch, loops)<br>
• Functions & scope<br>
• Arrays and objects<br>
• DOM Manipulation<br>
• Events and event delegation<br>
• ES6+ Features: let, const, arrow functions, destructuring, template literals<br>

📦 Project Milestone:<br>
• Build a static homepage for the Smart Service Portal<br>
• Add interactive features like a working service request form using JS<br>

✅ Phase 1 Test: JavaScript Basics (MCQs + Coding)<br>
• Explain var, let, and const<br>
• Write a function to find the largest number in an array<br>
• Describe event delegation<br>
• Code a dynamic dropdown menu from a list of services<br>

🔗 #__Phase 2: React.js Core__
<br>🔧 Tasks:
• Setting up React with Vite or CRA<br>
• JSX and components (functional components)<br>
• State and props<br>
• Event handling<br>
• Conditional rendering<br>
• List rendering with map()<br>
• Basic forms with controlled components<br>
• Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and Material-UI.<br>

📦 Project Milestone:<br>
• Build the service listing page in React<br>
• Display services from a static JSON file<br>
• Implement add-to-cart behavior (locally with state)<br>

✅ Phase 2 Test: React Fundamentals<br>
• Difference between props and state<br>
• Build a component that filters services based on category<br>
• React interview questions like "What is reconciliation?" or "Why use keys in lists?"<br>

🧭 #__Phase 3: Routing, Context & Hooks__
<br>🔧 Tasks:
• React Router (v6)<br>
• useEffect, useState, useContext<br>
• Lifting state<br>
• Global state with Context API<br>
• Reusable components and structure best practices<br>

📦 Project Milestone:<br>
• Build navigation across pages (Home, Services, Contact, Login)<br>
• Build a service details page with routing and shared layout<br>
• Add user login form (state only, no backend yet)<br>

✅ Phase 3 Test: Intermediate React<br>
• Code a component using useEffect to fetch data<br>
• Explain how context is different from props drilling<br>
• Design a nested route structure<br>
• Questions on hooks lifecycle and dependency array<br>

🧱 #__Phase 4: Backend with Spring Boot__
<br>🔧 Tasks:
• Java refresher: OOP, collections, streams<br>
• Spring Boot setup and project structure<br>
• REST API basics (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)<br>
• Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern<br>
• Using Lombok, validation, and error handling<br>
• API testing with Postman<br>

📦 Project Milestone:<br>
• Create backend for services: /api/services<br>
• Implement CRUD for services (in-memory first, then database)<br>
• Create a REST API for login/signup<br>

✅ Phase 4 Test: Spring Boot API<br>
• Define REST and its principles<br>
• Write a Spring Boot controller with 2 endpoints<br>
• Questions on dependency injection, annotations (@RestController, @Autowired)<br>

💾 #__Phase 5: Database Integration__
<br>🔧 Tasks:
• MySQL/PostgreSQL basics: schema, relations, SQL queries<br>
• JPA and Hibernate in Spring Boot<br>
• Entities, repositories, relationships (@OneToMany, @ManyToOne)<br>
• DTOs and mapping<br>
• Pagination and filtering<br>

📦 Project Milestone:<br>
• Connect your service and user models to the database<br>
• Store bookings, users, and services<br>
• Add filtering to get services by type/price<br>

✅ Phase 5 Test: Database & JPA<br>
• Draw an ER diagram for your app<br>
• Write SQL queries for joins and filters<br>
• Map a User and Booking relation using JPA annotations<br>

🛡️ #__Phase 6: Full Integration + Advanced Features__
🔧 Tasks:
• Frontend-backend connection using Axios/Fetch
• Authentication (JWT or Spring Security)
• Role-based access (user/admin)
• Form validation (React & Spring)
• Deploy backend (Heroku, Render)
• Deploy frontend (Netlify, Vercel)

#__Bonus:__ Integrate Stripe/PayPal or send email confirmations

📦 Final Project Completion:<br>
• Frontend: React with full API integration<br>
• Backend: Spring Boot + DB with full CRUD and auth<br>
• Complete working Smart Service Portal<br>

✅ Final Test: Full-Stack Challenge<br>
• Integrate login using JWT and protect routes<br>
• Solve a task like: “Add service rating & review feature”<br>
• Mock interview questions:<br>
• Please walk me through your project architecture<br>
• How do you secure an API?<br>
• What’s the difference between stateful and stateless APIs?<br>
